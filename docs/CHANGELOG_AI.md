# CHANGELOG_AI.md

This file is updated by Codex after every task.

## 2026-07-01 — Set up self-updating project memory

### Summary

* Added repository-level project memory and future-agent instructions.
* Documented confirmed product overview, architecture, business rules, integrations, SEO/content behavior, deployment notes, known pitfalls, and prior decisions.
* Added the rule that Codex must read memory before non-trivial tasks and update changelog/memory after completed tasks.

### Files changed

* `AGENTS.md` — added required memory workflow, what to store/avoid, and repository rules.
* `docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` — created durable project memory with product, architecture, deployment, integration, SEO, pitfalls, decisions, and do-not-repeat notes.
* `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` — created AI changelog and logged this memory setup task.
* `docs/BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md` — documented business/product context.
* `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — documented runtime, PM2, nginx, environment, and deployment checks.
* `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — documented scanner, CNAME, DNS, RSS, and SQLite integration contracts.
* `docs/SEO_MEMORY.md` — documented SEO/content behavior and current limitations.

### Decisions

* Memory files live inside the repository and must be maintained as part of future tasks.
* Sensitive values, raw logs, generated databases, previews, and secrets must not be stored in memory.

### Checks run

* Read existing `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `run.sh`, `.gitignore`, `app.py`, nginx configs, PM2 process details, Git history, and SQLite schema.
* Confirmed `python3 -m py_compile app.py` still passes before creating memory files.

### Risks / TODO

* Keep memory concise and durable; avoid turning it into a duplicate of the full codebase.
* Future agents must update this file after every completed task.

## 2026-07-01 — Clean up topic discovery signal quality

### Summary

* Removed Reddit/Google source failures from selectable signal cards.
* Increased topic discovery capacity to 20 usable signals per source.
* Added relevance scoring, deduplication, and Reddit discussion filtering so article ideas are based on top/relevant signals instead of random or error items.
* Updated the manage-page UI to show source warnings as notes and display signal counts.

### Files changed

* `app.py` — changed Google and Reddit signal fetchers to return `(signals, warnings)`, added scoring/filtering, updated `/topic-signals` API payload, and updated signal UI rendering.
* `docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` — recorded the durable rule that source errors must be warnings, not cards.
* `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — documented the topic discovery contract and limitations.
* `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` — logged this task.

### Decisions

* Do not pad the signal grid with low-relevance or failed-source items just to increase card count.
* Reddit RSS 429 is an expected degraded state and should not block Google signals.

### Checks run

* `python3 -m py_compile app.py`
* Restarted PM2 process `blog-yas-core`.
* Checked `http://127.0.0.1:3299/api/sites/5/topic-signals` for `week`, `month`, `3m`, and `6m`; confirmed no disabled/error cards and no zero-score returned signals.

### Risks / TODO

* Reddit RSS can still rate-limit; a more reliable Reddit integration may require API credentials or caching/backoff.
* Current Google source is Google News RSS, not official Google Trends.

## 2026-07-01 — Add YAS Wine factory parity backbone

### Summary

* Audited `/var/www/content-factory-yaswine` for article jobs, social publishing, autopublish, topic discovery, and generation flow.
* Added a parity map documenting which YAS Wine factory capabilities must exist in universal Blog Core.
* Added per-site Blog Core schema for article production jobs, job logs, social connections, social posts, autopublish settings/runs, and topic discovery settings/runs.
* Added manage-page Production Queue and Distribution/autopublish settings UI.
* Changed selected topic signals to create real `content_jobs`, not only legacy `publish_jobs`.
* Added a universal Gemini draft-generation contract for `content_jobs` that uses connected site context instead of wine-only rules.

### Files changed

* `app.py` — added factory parity tables, per-site settings helpers/endpoints, content job creation/list/detail/generate routes, manage-page production/distribution panels, and universal article draft generation.
* `docs/FACTORY_PARITY.md` — added the source-to-target parity map from YAS Wine factory to Blog Core.
* `docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` — recorded durable parity decision.
* `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — documented current backbone and pending provider/publish parity work.
* `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` — logged this task.

### Decisions

* Provider credentials and publishing settings must be scoped by `site_id`.
* Do not copy the YAS Wine prompt literally into Blog Core; use the same quality contract with site-specific context.
* Keep old `publish_jobs` as legacy/service jobs while new article production uses `content_jobs`.

### Checks run

* `python3 -m py_compile app.py`
* Ran `init_db()` against the live SQLite database to create new tables.
* Restarted PM2 process `blog-yas-core`.
* Checked `/health`.
* Smoke-tested `/api/sites/5/factory-settings`, `/api/sites/5/article-ideas`, and `/api/sites/5/content-jobs/<job_id>`; removed smoke job afterward.

### Risks / TODO

* Full parity is not finished yet: real social publishing routes, OAuth callbacks, autopublish runner, and final publish/localization/sitemap/GSC behavior still need to be ported.
* Real Gemini generation route exists but was not smoke-run to avoid spending model calls on a test topic.

## 2026-07-01 — Tighten Reddit topic relevance

### Summary

* Fixed Reddit topic discovery passing unrelated discussions when they matched only generic words from the site topic seed.
* Added a stricter Reddit relevance gate requiring a strong site-topic anchor plus contextual title match.
* Verified that broad YAS Wine false positives such as generic food/SNAP/mountain supply posts are rejected.

### Files changed

* `app.py` — added Reddit weak-term filtering, shared term matching, and `reddit_signal_is_relevant()` for stronger discussion filtering.
* `docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` — recorded the durable Reddit relevance rule.
* `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — documented the stricter Reddit signal contract.
* `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` — logged this task.

### Decisions

* Prefer returning zero Reddit cards with a warning over showing random or weakly related discussions.

### Checks run

* `python3 -m py_compile app.py`
* Restarted PM2 process `blog-yas-core`.
* Checked `http://127.0.0.1:3299/health`.
* Checked `/api/sites/5/topic-signals?range=month`; Reddit false positives were removed and the API returned a no-relevant-Reddit warning.

### Risks / TODO

* Reddit RSS can still rate-limit or return sparse results. A better long-term solution is a credentialed Reddit API integration with subreddit/topic expansion and caching.
